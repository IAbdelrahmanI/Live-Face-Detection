# Live-Face-Detection

This basic face detection procedure is made to be used for my next applications, embedded system based applications to be specific. 


Main Idea (Basic Thoughts):

The "Haar Cascade" algorithm used here mainly searches through every single scale of image within the frame it is looping through getting the scale greater and greater until it reaches the complete single frame ("funneling" through the whole frame), after that, it goes to the next frame of the video.
